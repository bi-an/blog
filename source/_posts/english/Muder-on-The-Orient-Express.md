Miss Mary Debenham

Salacak

Welcome aboard.

Bosporus Ferry will shortly depart from Istanbul Sirkeci Station, connecting with the Orient Express.

Here's your ticket, Monsieur Poirot. I'm afraid you've still got another hour.

Well, then, please do not wait.

Not wait? After all you've done for us, Monsieur Poriot? My general's orders were to ensure your safe departure. He also wished me to thank you again for saving the honor of the British garrison in Jordan. The brigadier's confession was opportune. I say, how did you do it? Was it the old thumbscrew, you know, the rack?

Chop-chop

I hope we did the right thing booking you into a hotel on the European side rather than the Asia side.
我希望我们给你预订的是欧洲酒店而不是亚洲酒店是正确的。

I have no prejudice with either continent.

The crossing should be pleasant. The Borporus is always calm.
穿行应该会很愉快。博斯普鲁斯海峡总是很平静。

You have crossed by the ferry?
你乘渡船穿渡过？
